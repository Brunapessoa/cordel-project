# Cordel Project â€” Modern Cordel

This project is a web page inspired by the aesthetics of Brazilian cordel literature, bringing a modern poem by Milton Duarte adapted into an attractive and responsive visual format.
The site uses modern CSS features, including a parallax effect, to create a dynamic and immersive visual experience.
Technologies Used: 
    HTML5 for content structure
    CSS3 for styling and visual effects
    Google Fonts for custom typography (Abril Fatface and Patrick Hand)
    Parallax effect applied to specific sections using background-attachment: fixed

Features and Highlights:
    Responsive layout with font sizes and spacing that adapt using vw and vh units
    Parallax effect on sections with background images (#imgParal01 and #imgParal02), adding depth and motion when scrolling
    Custom typography to reinforce the poetic aesthetic
    Text blocks with semi-transparent backgrounds for better readability over images
    Styled links with a hover effect
    Semantic HTML structure using header, main, section, and footer
