                I’m getting kind of tired<br>
                Of all this technology<br>
                We just talk through e-mail now<br>
                Short and cold, with no warm plea<br>
                Twitter and Facebook, too<br>
                Before I’m old and through<br>
                I’ll say it all in poetry.

                It’s no longer like before<br>
                Everything is shortened down<br>
                “You” now has just two letters<br>
                The “O” and “E” thrown out and gone<br>
                To declare your love today<br>
                You just send a flower away<br>
                And a drawn heart gets it done.

                The “at” sign doesn’t weigh a thing<br>
                It’s part of an address<br>
                A period’s hardly used at all<br>
                Or comes at the start, no less<br>
                Now it’s all “.com” instead<br>
                If the website’s widely read<br>
                It’s worth a high-priced guess.

                To make the language stranger still<br>
                The emoticon is a mark<br>
                There’s a symbol for everything now<br>
                Semicolon or asterisk spark<br>
                A kiss is now a sign you make<br>
                To know what it’s supposed to take<br>
                You must decode that scribbled arc.

                I miss the days of letters<br>
                Written by one’s very hand<br>
                You’d send them out in June,<br>
                By Summer’s end they’d land<br>
                But they’d quench your longing ache<br>
                They were words you’d truly make<br>
                Lines from the heart, so grand.

                Now I write and send away<br>
                It reaches in a blink of time<br>
                But when I go to have a chat<br>
                The person’s left the line<br>
                They’ve opened another app instead<br>
                And the whole wide world’s been led<br>
                By technology’s current chime.

                Thankfully, when it’s time to pray<br>
                No internet is required<br>
                God hears every single one<br>
                If you doubt, you can inquire<br>
                Two colons are two knees bent<br>
                Your lips the speech instrument<br>
                And God will read what you’ve inspired.
